## Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) & Web Marketing

### Keywords

Keyword research was performed using Google search results and [Wordtracker](https://www.wordtracker.com/). A mixture of short tail and long tail keywords were considered based on their relevance, authority and volume, aiming to identify keywords that are high enough volumes and low enough competition. 

During the research, it was found that the word "sunscreen" and "sunblock" were used interchangeably (although they are technically different based on their purpose) and that the volume of searches was much higher for the word "sunscreen." Therefore, both words have been included in the keywords which have been added to the site's keywords and description sections in the head element.
