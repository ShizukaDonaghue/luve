## Code Validation

### HTML
All HTML pages were validated using [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check for any issues or syntax errors. The only errors identified were related to Summernote fields and Clearable_file_input widget. Please see the results below for each page.

<details>
  <summary>Home Page - No issues or errors</summary>
  
  <img src="docs/images/testing/html-home-page.png" width=700>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Sign Up Page - No issues or errors</summary>
  
  <img src="docs/images/testing/html-signup-page.png" width=700>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Log In Page - No issues or errors</summary>

</details>


<details>
  <summary>Log Out Page - No issues or errors</summary>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Articles Page - No issues or errors</summary> 
  
  <img src="docs/images/testing/html-articles-page.png" width=700>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Article Details Page - No issues or errors</summary> 
  
  <img src="docs/images/testing/html-article-detail-page.png" width=700>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Add Article Page - Errors identified for Summernote fields & clearable_file_input widget</summary> 
  
  <img src="docs/images/testing/html-add-article-page-1.png" width=700>
  <img src="docs/images/testing/html-add-article-page-2.png" width=700>
  <img src="docs/images/testing/html-add-article-page-3.png" width=700>

</details>

There were 10 errors identified in total. The first 9 errors were related to the Summernote widget that is used in the article form. Since the errors resulted from Summernote codes, these were not addressed. The last error was related to clearable_file_input widget used for the image field within the form and thus this was not addressed as modifying it would break the code. While these errors were not addressed, they do not affect the functionality of the application.

<details>
  <summary>Edit Article Page - Errors identified for Summernote fields & clearable_file_input widget</summary>

## Bugs
### Resolved Bugs

* **Modal for Delete Product Review [#84](https://github.com/ShizukaDonaghue/luve/issues/84)**  

  ***Issue:***  
  When a user tries to delete a product review, a modal is displayed to confirm deletion. Where there were multiple product reviews for a product by the same user, when the user confirmed to delete a product review in the modal displayed, the first review by the user was deleted regardless of which review the user was trying to delete.

  ***Solution:***  
  This issue was caused by the modal having the same ID for all product reviews for the user.
  It was resolved by giving each modal a separate ID, containing the review ID and then calling that specific modal to delete the review. This solution was found in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70346755/django-deleting-using-modal-show-and-delete-only-the-first-item-from-the-tabl).

* **Negative Product Price [#85](https://github.com/ShizukaDonaghue/luve/issues/85)**  

  ***Issue:***  
  When adding a product to the site, the product price field accepted prices that were less than 0.01 euro.  

  <img src="docs/images/testing/negative-product-price.png" width=300>     
       
  ***Solution:***  
  To validate the product price field, MinValueValidator has been added to the model to accept prices that are 0.01 and above. JQuery plug-in has also been added to raise an error message if a price lower than 0.01 is entered.

* **Stripe Payments Failure [#86](https://github.com/ShizukaDonaghue/luve/issues/86)**  

  ***Issue:***  
  Strip payment failed due to the payment method not being provided.   
   
  ***Solution:***  
  This issue resulted from jQuery plug-in validation that was added to validate the checkout form. It was firing the form submission before Stripe could finish processing payment. Once the validation was removed, payments were successful. The final solution applied was to update the jQuery validation to call the checkout function instead of form.submit function, which resolved the issue. This solution was found in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47332825/jquery-functions-not-firing-with-stripe-elements).


* **Brand Names with Space [#90](https://github.com/ShizukaDonaghue/luve/issues/90)**  

  ***Issue:***  
  The business owner/staff could add new brands to the store by entering a new brand name into the database without having to update the model itself. This functionality functioned as expected, however, when a brand name with a space is entered, it created an HTML validation error as space is not allowed.  
   
  ***Solution:***  
  The brand model has been updated to include display_name field so that the business owner/staff can enter a brand name as they would like to see it on their site. However, they will need to enter the name without space in the brand name field, so this is not an ideal solution. 
  
  For future development, a frond end panel will be created so that the business owner/staff can just enter the brand name as they would like to see it on their site and it will be converted to an acceptable format and stored in the database. Due to time constraints, this proposed solution will not be implemented for PP5 submission, and therefore, [#91](https://github.com/ShizukaDonaghue/luve/issues/91) has been created to track this issue.


* **Checkout Form Accepts Invalid Fields [#92](https://github.com/ShizukaDonaghue/luve/issues/92)**  

  ***Issue:***  
  Checkout form was submitted for Stripe payments even when the form was invalid. It allowed whitespace in fields other than the card details and created a 500 error when it was submitted for payment. 
   
  ***Solution:***  
  First, in order to prevent the form from being submitted for payments before the form is completed correctly, the jQuery validation which called the checkout function (resulting from [#86](https://github.com/ShizukaDonaghue/luve/issues/86) above) was removed as it did alert the user that the details were incomplete but still allowed the form to be submitted for payment once the card details were entered correctly. 
  
  Instead, regular expressions were added to the form to prevent invalid forms from being submitted for payment. This solution was found in [PP5-Fresh-Nest](https://github.com/AliOKeeffe/PP5-Fresh-Nest/blob/main/checkout/forms.py) repository.
